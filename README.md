This is the Unity game I developed for my final project in my third year at City University. Creating this game was an enjoyable experience, and I plan to continue improving it. The game is a Pok√©mon-style survival adventure, where the monsters grow increasingly stronger as the game progresses.

NOTE: Some assets in this game were created by me using Aseprite for pixel art, while other assets (e.g., sounds, characters, etc.) were either obtained for free or purchased from the Unity Store. This game was created for educational purposes only
